<p class="stagedirection">Enter two Gentlemen</p>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline">You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods</p>
<p class="speechline">No more obey the heavens than our courtiers</p>
<p class="speechline">Still seem as does the king.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline">But what's the matter?</p>
</div></div>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline">His daughter, and the heir of &rsquo;s kingdom, whom</p>
<p class="speechline">He purposed to his wife's sole son&mdash;a widow</p>
<p class="speechline">That late he married&mdash;hath referr'd herself</p>
<p class="speechline">Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;</p>
<p class="speechline">Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all</p>
<p class="speechline">Is outward sorrow; though I think the king</p>
<p class="speechline">Be touch'd at very heart.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline">None but the king?</p>
</div></div>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline">He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,</p>
<p class="speechline">That most desired the match; but not a courtier,</p>
<p class="speechline">Although they wear their faces to the bent</p>
<p class="speechline">Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not</p>
<p class="speechline">Glad at the thing they scowl at.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline">And why so?</p>
</div></div>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline">He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing</p>
<p class="speechline">Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her&mdash;</p>
<p class="speechline">I mean, that married her, alack, good man!</p>
<p class="speechline">And therefore banish'd&mdash;is a creature such</p>
<p class="speechline">As, to seek through the regions of the earth</p>
<p class="speechline">For one his like, there would be something failing</p>
<p class="speechline">In him that should compare. I do not think</p>
<p class="speechline">So fair an outward and such stuff within</p>
<p class="speechline">Endows a man but he.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline">You speak him far.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline">I do extend him, sir, within himself,</p>
<p class="speechline">Crush him together rather than unfold</p>
<p class="speechline">His measure duly.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline droppedline">What's his name and birth?</p>
</div></div>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline">I cannot delve him to the root: his father</p>
<p class="speechline">Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour</p>
<p class="speechline">Against the Romans with Cassibelan,</p>
<p class="speechline">But had his titles by Tenantius whom</p>
<p class="speechline">He served with glory and admired success,</p>
<p class="speechline">So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;</p>
<p class="speechline">And had, besides this gentleman in question,</p>
<p class="speechline">Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time</p>
<p class="speechline">Died with their swords in hand; for which their father,</p>
<p class="speechline">Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow</p>
<p class="speechline">That he quit being, and his gentle lady,</p>
<p class="speechline">Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased</p>
<p class="speechline">As he was born. The king he takes the babe</p>
<p class="speechline">To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,</p>
<p class="speechline">Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,</p>
<p class="speechline">Puts to him all the learnings that his time</p>
<p class="speechline">Could make him the receiver of; which he took,</p>
<p class="speechline">As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,</p>
<p class="speechline">And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court&mdash;</p>
<p class="speechline">Which rare it is to do&mdash;most praised, most loved,</p>
<p class="speechline">A sample to the youngest, to the more mature</p>
<p class="speechline">A glass that feated them, and to the graver</p>
<p class="speechline">A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,</p>
<p class="speechline">For whom he now is banish'd, her own price</p>
<p class="speechline">Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;</p>
<p class="speechline">By her election may be truly read</p>
<p class="speechline">What kind of man he is.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline droppedline">I honour him</p>
<p class="speechline">Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,</p>
<p class="speechline">Is she sole child to the king?</p>
</div></div>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline droppedline">His only child.</p>
<p class="speechline">He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,</p>
<p class="speechline">Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,</p>
<p class="speechline">I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery</p>
<p class="speechline">Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge</p>
<p class="speechline">Which way they went.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline droppedline">How long is this ago?</p>
</div></div>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline">Some twenty years.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline">That a king's children should be so convey'd,</p>
<p class="speechline">So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,</p>
<p class="speechline">That could not trace them!</p>
</div></div>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline droppedline">Howsoe'er &rsquo;tis strange,</p>
<p class="speechline">Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,</p>

</div></div>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline droppedline">I do well believe you.</p>

<p class="speechline">No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,</p>
<p class="speechline">After the slander of most stepmothers,</p>
<p class="speechline">Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but</p>
<p class="speechline">Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys</p>
<p class="speechline">That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,</p>
<p class="speechline">So soon as I can win the offended king,</p>
<p class="speechline">I will be known your advocate: marry, yet</p>
<p class="speechline">The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good</p>

<p class="speechline droppedline">Please your highness,</p>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">QUEEN</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline droppedline">You know the peril.</p>
<p class="speechline">I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying</p>

<p class="speechline">Always reserved my holy duty&mdash;what</p>
<p class="speechline">His rage can do on me: you must be gone;</p>
<p class="speechline">And I shall here abide the hourly shot</p>
<p class="speechline">Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,</p>
<p class="speechline">But that there is this jewel in the world</p>

<p class="speechline">Nay, stay a little:</p>

<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline">By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;</p>

<p class="speechline">Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,</p>
<p class="speechline">Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methought</p>
<p class="speechline">Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,</p>
<p class="speechline">Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows</p>
<p class="speechline">Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found</p>
<p class="speechline">This label on my bosom; whose containing</p>
<p class="speechline">Is so from sense in hardness, that I can</p>
<p class="speechline">Make no collection of it: let him show</p>
<p class="speechline">His skill in the construction.</p>

<p class="speechline">unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a</p>
<p class="speechline">piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar</p>
<p class="speechline">shall be lopped branches, which, being dead many</p>
<p class="speechline">years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old</p>
<p class="speechline">stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end</p>
<p class="speechline">his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in</p>
<p class="speechline">peace and plenty.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="speechline">Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;</p>
<p class="speechline">The fit and apt construction of thy name,</p>
<p class="speechline">Being Leonatus, doth import so much.</p>
<p class="stagedirection">To CYMBELINE</p>
<p class="speechline">The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,</p>
<p class="speechline">Which we call &lsquo;mollis aer;' and &lsquo;mollis aer'</p>

<p class="speechline">Is this most constant wife; who, even now,</p>
<p class="speechline">Answering the letter of the oracle,</p>
<p class="speechline">Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about</p>

<p class="speechline">The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,</p>

<p class="speechline">Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,</p>
<p class="speechline">For many years thought dead, are now revived,</p>
<p class="speechline">To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue</p>

<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline droppedline">Well</p>
<p class="speechline">My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,</p>
<p class="speechline">Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,</p>
<p class="speechline">And to the Roman empire; promising</p>
<p class="speechline">To pay our wonted tribute, from the which</p>
<p class="speechline">We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;</p>

<div class="speechact"><p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="speechline">The fingers of the powers above do tune</p>
<p class="speechline">The harmony of this peace. The vision</p>
<p class="speechline">Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke</p>
<p class="speechline">Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant</p>
<p class="speechline">Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,</p>
<p class="speechline">From south to west on wing soaring aloft,</p>
<p class="speechline">Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun</p>
<p class="speechline">So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,</p>
<p class="speechline">The imperial Caesar, should again unite</p>
<p class="speechline">His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,</p>
<p class="speechline">Which shines here in the west.</p>

<p class="speechline">A Roman and a British ensign wave</p>
<p class="speechline">Friendly together: so through Lud's-town march:</p>
<p class="speechline">And in the temple of great Jupiter</p>
<p class="speechline">Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.</p>
<p class="speechline">Set on there! Never was a war did cease,</p>
